This paper provides the first time-series analysis of labour market concentration in Canada, complementing
prior research on the U.S. and other countries. It shows that national concentration gradually
declined from 2001 to 2019, while local concentration experienced a temporary rise of 14% during the
Great Recession. Decomposition analysis reveals that the long-run decline in both concentrations reflects
two offsetting forces: increased within-industry competition, which reduced concentration, and
wage-bill shifts toward more concentrated sectors, which partially offset these gains. However, during
the Great Recession, this pattern reverses at the local level: 68% of the increase was due to sectoral
reallocation.
