<small>
This paper provides the first time-series analysis of labour market concentration in Canada, 
complementing prior research on the U.S. and other countries. It shows that national concentration 
gradually declined from 2001 to 2019, while local concentration experienced a temporary rise of 14% 
during the Great Recession. Decomposition analysis reveals that the long-run decline reflects two 
offsetting forces: increased within-industry competition, which reduced concentration, and wage-bill 
shifts toward more concentrated sectors, which partially offset these gains. During the Great 
Recession, the pattern reverses at the local level: 68% of the increase in local concentration 
was driven by sectoral reallocation toward more concentrated industries.
