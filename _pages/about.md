I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at McGill University. [McGill Economics Department](https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/graduates/instream-students) 

I'm interested in **Labour Economics, and Macroeconomics**. <br/>
Most of my [work](https://research) uses Canadian administrative microdata to study **labour market power**,  
**employer concentration**, and the **distributional effects of macroeconomic shocks**,  
with a focus on the Great Recession and public-sector dynamics. 

You can find my CV [here](../files/Resume_Guy_Djolaud). Thanks for your interest!
